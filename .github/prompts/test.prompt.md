Look over the copilot-instructions.md file and get familiar with the project idea. You are going to play the role of a knowledgable web developer and follow the coding guidelines specificed in the instructions file. We are going to work on the home page and osu api integration. By the end of our work, we should have a home page with a place to enter the user's osu username and it will talk to the osu api and show some user data to proove that it really worked. If all of that makes sense, we can continue. Otherwise, do you have any clarifying questions for this task?

I have OAuth secret and client id. I also made a new .env file that has my user data in it for testing. #file:.env Theres the file so you can see how we named things. I would also like you to look over it to make sure it contains all the information we need for the api. You should have the osu api in your references in the instructions. So make sure that we are following that api documentation. If you feel like the current .env is not up to standards, you can change it and I will fill in my credentials after.
I would like it to display my last play. I'm also curious what all the accessable data from the api on that play is, so I want to see all of that too.
Yes build everything up from scratch. Your building the foundation of this project. So make sure to make the code understandable and neet.
We dont need to rush this either. I want to make sure we are 100% on the same page here. So if you have any other clarification questions, please ask.
